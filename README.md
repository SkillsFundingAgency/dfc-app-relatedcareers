# Digital First Careers - Related Careers app

This project provides a Related Careers app for use in the Job Profiles app, which is a part of the Composite UI (Shell application) to dynamically output markup from Related Careers data sources.

Details of the Job Profiles application may be found here https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/dfc-app-jobprofiles

Details of the Composite UI application may be found here https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/dfc-composite-shell

This Related Careers app runs in two flavours:

* Related Careers segments
* Draft Related Careers segments

## Getting Started

This is a self-contained Visual Studio 2019 solution containing a number of projects (web application, service and repository layers, with associated unit test and integration test projects).

### Installing

Clone the project and open the solution in Visual Studio 2019.

## List of dependencies

|Item	|Purpose|
|-------|-------|
|Sitefinity |Content management system |
|Azure Cosmos DB | Document storage |

## Local Config Files

Once you have cloned the public repo you need to rename the appsettings files by removing the -template part from the configuration file names listed below.

| Location | Repo Filename | Rename to |
|-------|-------|-------|
| DFC.App.RelatedCareers.IntegrationTests | appsettings-template.json | appsettings.json |
| DFC.App.RelatedCareers | appsettings-template.json | appsettings.json |

## Configuring to run locally

The project contains a number of "appsettings-template.json" files which contain sample appsettings for the web app and the integration test projects. To use these files, rename them to "appsettings.json" and edit and replace the configuration item values with values suitable for your environment.

By default, the appsettings include a local Azure Cosmos Emulator configuration using the well known configuration values. These may be changed to suit your environment if you are not using the Azure Cosmos Emulator. In addition, Sitefinity configuration settings will need to be edited.

| appsettings.json     | SitefinityApi.SitefinityApiDataEndpoint |< your domain api data endpoint >  |
| appsettings.json     | SitefinityApi.ClientId           | < can be obtained from sitefinity  >|
| appsettings.json     | SitefinityApi.ClientSecret       | < generate it with sitefinity >     |
| appsettings.json     | SitefinityApi.Username           | < sitefinity username >             |
| appsettings.json     | SitefinityApi.Password           | < sitefinity password >             |
| appsettings.json     | SitefinityApi.Scopes             | < authentication protocol> OpenId   |

## Running locally

To run this product locally, you will need to configure the list of dependencies. Once configured and the configuration files updated, it should be F5 to run and debug locally. The application can be run using IIS Express or full IIS.

To run the project, start the web application. Once running, browse to the main entrypoint which is the "https://localhost:44340/segments". This will list all of the Related Careers segments available and from here, you can navigate to the individual Related Careers segments.

The Related Careers app is designed to be run from within the Job Profiles app, which in turn is run from within the Composite UI, therefore running the Related Careers app outside of the other apps will only show simple views of the data.

## Deployments

This Related Careers app will be deployed as an individual deployment for consumption by the Composite UI.
